0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,110
Right? Um, the two question I-I want you to discuss

1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,640
the group and turn into order the results.

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:23,200
Right to T-A, one of the question is about, um as a government agency, I said this on national defense, on departments.

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,450
So what we think about defense?

4
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,190
National defense is something related to military, right?

5
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:35,690
It should be very complex. So think about it is a complex system, right?

6
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,870
Complex system. So it is not a tiny one.

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,800
It is a big one, complex one.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,260
And it should be very reliable, right?

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,730
It has a pretty line. Anything take long, right?

10
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,940
So then you can take up some methodology that's not suitable.

11
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,600
You're not going to use programming course.

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:08,820
All right, so you should think about reliable.

13
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,780
You have longer no time allowed to finish that.

14
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,540
So the best answer should be water.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:31,200
Water. All right, so you gotta use water for because the national or governmental agency, they need documents, right?

16
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:50,450
There is water for. If your answer is parallel, then you you have enough staff to to give them, and then they can talk the sub sub project.

17
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:57,180
All right. Okay, so then usually address that.

18
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,280
Well, this project is very, very complex, and they need documents.

19
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:12,800
I'm near the deadline. And the requirement should be very stable by because they are not going to to to change that often.

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,850
So you're going to use structure methodology.

21
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,070
It could be word for and used.

22
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:31,690
That's on, well, we haven't experienced pressure manager, and they know or here, she knows how to subdivide it.

23
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,360
This the group into, you know, this project, right?

24
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,720
They can shorten, shorten the development periods, then you use peril.

25
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:54,920
So fine this. And the 3rd question is about an executive CEO, right?

26
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:07,850
Wants to have an innovative, innovative function.

27
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:35,220
They can't help drill down, or have a quick summary up the company, or Chris, summary, would you down with the graphical display on so that function she be very new and fancy.

28
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,510
So the best question would be extreme programming, right?

29
00:03:42,910 --> 00:04:12,170
Because in you matter with the Secretary of CEO, often, all right, about the heat, or get some some requirement, or needs up, S-E-O-N, you just do it the dad, right?

30
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,710
And probably would change very often, right?

31
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:29,480
Because even the see, you just has super notion about effects to show, right?

32
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:47,590
And you're the member the design team, you should propose in conduct the design right in a quick way, and changes often, right?

33
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,160
And meet requirements the CEO in a very short time.

34
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,120
So the best methodology will be extreme programming.

35
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,390
You must say that I want to use scrum.

36
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:12,430
Well, scrum could be try. Yeah, that's the secondary choice, I guess.

37
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,350
One you have a formal

38
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,270
team, right?

39
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:24,600
Um, and you will, yeah, probably you can use squams, the scrams more formal.

40
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:42,990
You have lots of program and, um, you have a fix schedule by the bend on chart, because you're going to finish that in a very, very short time to do the events by the activity.

41
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:51,150
I'm so you can, you can use squam, right?

42
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:57,190
But school, the team is bigger than it shouldn't programming.

43
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:03,690
So, like, see yours, then you actually you need to use squam, right?

44
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,750
But you want to use this?

45
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,050
The 2nd choice, the best way will be train programming.

46
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,940
Okay, so just two questions. I want to see the answer like that.

47
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:23,690
Yeah, it's alex Is question Good.

48
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:37,310
I would have to ask a question Where do we draw the line between the project, when we call it?

49
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,930
This is a long project, and which one we call This is a short project?

50
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,990
Like, where do we divide the line?

51
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,950
Is it like six months, three months a year to us?

52
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,840
Ten years? Like, okay, it's pretty good.

53
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,240
Look a good. Um, question. So what do you think about it?

54
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,440
Says, um, I want to have this function in half an year.

55
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,540
You think is long or short?

56
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,780
That's all things long future. It is such a own project.

57
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,750
So, uh, well, actually, six months is quite short, right?

58
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:26,010
So, yeah, it's a question we don't have a definite um or a precise answer.

59
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:35,970
The good, good question. Well, it's basic, no, basically, you want to embrace a project, have an year by six months.

60
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:42,010
We regarded the shot, brian or another thing.

61
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,190
They, um, want to watch video?

62
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,710
I'll give you a video. Um, when we got to watch that.

63
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:58,940
What you what you think about if I said that's on is 20 min is short?

64
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:04,590
Hello, um. Well, it depends on what kind of video.

65
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,030
If its documentary and is short, if it's like a movie, then it is short.

66
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,170
But if it's like a flaw, then it is wrong.

67
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,150
So depends on the video company.

68
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:24,640
Yeah, so we don't have an exact All right, so it was the government then usually this longer, take, longer with a complex tax, longer, right?

69
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,520
Is that is a small company, one year, probably soon.

70
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:42,910
OK, so when I say that on government agency, and you will not expect that three months or six months, but this is probably two year, right?

71
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,870
Two year, but there's a two year budgets to do that, right?

72
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,720
I'm so, yeah, so, good question.

73
00:08:50,880 --> 00:09:08,910
When I said, that's, um, well, the company, then state needs, um, a very innovative design, then you think that I cannot wait for for very long, like a year, to see the results, so it could be short, right?

74
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,430
So shorter than one year. So have an ear, right?

75
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,530
There any other question? Goods that may be heavier.

76
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,740
You raise a question again? Yes.

77
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,040
Well, I'm going to skip some.

78
00:09:37,200 --> 00:10:02,990
Um, what's going to jump to the Unified Process today s lesson why today, today s instruction basically is an extension the last week, because Dennis and comes by

79
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:13,190
introductions of the methodology. Not the same, but it is something in common.

80
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,680
All right, there's something common. This to book is something in common.

81
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,930
And in part of that is a different expression, right?

82
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:42,440
So this one unified process. You can see that in both textbook, the tennis infer process is a indified process, but you can you cannot see that in methodology.

83
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:51,230
All right. So how come is simified process a methodology?

84
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,550
Both of the books said, well, probably not.

85
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,790
It focused on process, a unified process.

86
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:12,070
So labels do not categorizes one of the methodology rights for any kind unified process.

87
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:28,270
Or we call this U-P, in short, up R-U-P, in short, it was purpose by a company called Rational, rational.

88
00:11:35,070 --> 00:12:20,880
So R-U-P uniform. So recently, we call this rap because this company, what's the acquired acquire boat by IBM, then IBM adopt this and become All right, so IBM implements their project by using unified process a lot.

89
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,610
IBM is an international company. We know it.

90
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:39,980
All right. It's very big company, and they have very big projects and very much complex.

91
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,090
All right, what you use inified process?

92
00:12:44,450 --> 00:13:02,970
So when we introduce different kinds of methodology, I said that if you are familiar with the methodology, you know how to combine them, you're not going to use just one methodology only, right?

93
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:12,790
So you're going to combine that in this process, unified process, because they use many kinds of methodology inside that, right?

94
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:21,660
If you have documentation, I unified process, but it is not a traditional one.

95
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:39,750
Gay And this process, all this matter, will produce different version, different version production, right?

96
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:56,720
Different version. And the difference between traditional methodology, because you you see that well, um, it is supporting activity overflow, so we can see engineering work, role and support.

97
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:02,120
Why is supporting engineering and supporting what for?

98
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:13,800
So it's specified that oil will not going to only model something some time, and then go to the next one.

99
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:27,130
Not traditional methodology. So we can see somehow, the quite similar to now we start right.

100
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:40,590
Planning is an inception initialization. Similar inception planning will use a different term, evaluation, students in detail and more.

101
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,250
So inception. Here it comes up with wine.

102
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:50,700
And yet we have what I know, so have how.

103
00:14:51,980 --> 00:15:01,000
All right, so what we said is, it's not like like traditional workforce inception.

104
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,840
We have the right what we need to do that.

105
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,430
And we also think about the supporting

106
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,950
activity, and we conduct it. So by using that,

107
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,150
because we have a very complex system.

108
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,790
So you're not going to use up

109
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,870
right to to design a very tiny project.

110
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,030
No, it should be very complex.

111
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:34,250
Something about IP And they help you understand that IBM is an international company.

112
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:50,050
Many branches, right? Different waterlets and different where has its distinct culture.

113
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:57,930
Right? So their system gotta be different, like to suit the needs of different country, right?

114
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:05,340
So make shorter, like 7-eleven. Seven is not just one, right?

115
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:14,810
One story that many branch by chance to wear a lot of store again.

116
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,990
So they should have a central processing.

117
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:29,070
And also they need to take care of the chance to win, right?

118
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:51,080
Distributed management. All right, so they need to keep the data, and also, you know, well, allow the chance the way has its different knees.

119
00:16:51,520 --> 00:17:05,720
All right, so it's make it complex, so that that then you want to design a system that that complex situation.

120
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:19,760
So group of professional comes from different areas need to talk about, but out of thing, because it's a very big All right, I need my test some function.

121
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,280
I am based on difference. Nice.

122
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:32,690
So you're going to see that you have idea and couple function.

123
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:39,990
Listen, priority. We might do some part and tests.

124
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:52,000
We might deploy means on implements in some children s store.

125
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,880
You can see the inception, so you can see the shaded, shaded area.

126
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:19,610
Shade is modeled as different places by the inception, not just business model in a requirement, some analysis, design, testing, the model us.

127
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:28,920
So for each phase, model us of the workflow, including the supporting, supporting a work floor.

128
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:38,260
All right, you see each face, we can subdivide its passionate, right?

129
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,260
As iteration. What is the difference from traditional one?

130
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,130
Because iteration is not going to go back.

131
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:54,910
Let's go forward. All right, and to this, so that, and then go forward.

132
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:03,290
You will finish that, the 1st version, and come to the others.

133
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,470
And you're going to see, E.G.

134
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:15,200
evaporation. The more requirements is come clear, and more functions.

135
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,410
Yeah, dance they're going to focus on.

136
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:27,900
So actually, no, there's a lot of mystology in this matter.

137
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:33,140
I or, you know, it's coon cod.

138
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,900
Is it a process, right? So it's unified or alphabets together.

139
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:46,920
We also can see extension extensions of the unified process, right?

140
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:58,840
So extend a modified version, extension that because you're going to see here production, what's Let me see which one.

141
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:27,070
No, it's good. We find it.

142
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,500
This is Semis, our previous one.

143
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,360
But extension. You're going to see this production, right?

144
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,720
Production is the release of the the, the pro line.

145
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,640
And supporting ones is going to see that well.

146
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:11,960
Keep operation, the operation, like the contents.

147
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,920
Chinese Chapter one on the new additional at focus on operation, right?

148
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:38,430
So you can see that up db O-P, step up the desk, the operation in support and infrastructure to management er.

149
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:52,690
It does not have the budget, right, but all that, or you can see that on that's included in the project management.

150
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:58,900
So configuration, change management, change management.

151
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:04,280
This about motion control. The changed is a version one.

152
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:18,450
When we when the change from the digits right there, from one to two is a big change.

153
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:23,970
If there's one that one want to that the small change, right?

154
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,790
So that is the change management about the birth control.

155
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:34,930
So here you can see that iteration and incremental, right?

156
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:47,670
So incrementally, from inception, a couple of iteration, each iteration has the added value, or equipment function, right?

157
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:53,240
And go forward until and production.

158
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,740
So production, that is the result, the in product.

159
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:04,760
So no exception need pollution, that added until, okay?

160
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:18,400
But for the supporting after, after releasing the the production, then we still need to provide service until year, or the maintenance as a production.

161
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:27,670
We can see that. So that is the extension of unified process, where it combines to two books together.

162
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:47,470
That's, um, it's around the time, right?

163
00:23:53,550 --> 00:24:00,640
That question. Hello. So which methodology to use?

164
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,970
Right? So, last time we sat down to to question.

165
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,940
And now I want you to practice.

166
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:20,060
Another two, Another two. So it's a new version history.

167
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,690
The version history do the exercise.

168
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:29,610
H and I in a group.

169
00:24:40,660 --> 00:25:03,080
The H especially. Suppose you are an analysis right, working for a small company, to develop an accounting system, accounting, so you're going to develop an accounting system.

170
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,330
We know the accounting is quite complex, even this small company.

171
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:14,670
Right? Accounting. I support salary wages online, and

172
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:25,470
believe personal leave, right? So er

173
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,100
one of the other approaches, and why?

174
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,420
So that is the 1st question.

175
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:37,270
I

176
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,950
small company needs a very complex,

177
00:25:41,760 --> 00:26:04,400
a difficult system. I suppose you are an analyst developing a new information system to automates the sales transaction and manage inventory, inventory for each retail store in a large chain.

178
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:22,790
The system should be installed at each store and exchange data with a mainframe computer at the company s head office, which use the infight process to develop the system, or which you prefer one of the other approaches?

179
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:43,810
Why? So these two questions I'm going to give you around on, because you're going to have a break, or I'm going to give you 25 min right?

180
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:51,520
So this two question If you don't have the book, take a picture here, right?

181
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:58,670
H and I, and discussing the group and turning your result to T-A.
