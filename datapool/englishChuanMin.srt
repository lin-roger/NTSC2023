00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,550
Hey, today is the 1st day of this

1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:11,140
voice. Right? Um, I'm pleased to see you attend course sometime.

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,140
This is the 1st time for most of students.

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,190
You probably are not familiar with the detouring that I need.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,240
Well, uh, it is not a traditional way.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:51,780
I-I-I do hope that, um, during our lectureing, there will be a light discussion, and I'm going to raise questions, and you answer or, um, you might expect that, um, teacher through and students through, not traditional way.

6
00:00:51,790 --> 00:01:02,640
So before, before this class, um, I hope that you are ready watch the video as the resources I gave.

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,740
So today I'm going to describe the course.

8
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,820
So it's, of course, this question.

9
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,780
Here we go. So we have a syllabus.

10
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:31,060
That is the syllabus. That means we could use schedule and the purpose of these schools, the requirements that, um, you should have, and the grading policy.

11
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,900
So 1st of all, I'm going to explain that, right?

12
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,570
We have a syllabus, right? Um, right?

13
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,630
Of course, make sure they come to the right class.

14
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,490
I 1st one is system analysis and Design game.

15
00:01:49,810 --> 00:02:08,010
And we're going to announce any message where on it's going to upload course resources on the trunk, trunk class, right?

16
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:17,760
So I hope that you, you know, the place to download all the resources before you come the including the service.

17
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,760
So the service, uh, is going to explain that?

18
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,620
Well, you know, um, I say, that's UH.

19
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:33,730
This course provides very very the proposal this course.

20
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:47,370
This course is enable you to do system analysis and design, or, you call this S-A or S-A-D, system analysis and design.

21
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:59,140
I said do because a lot of practice, it's not just freely based, so you buy things that's, well, this course belong to management, you know.

22
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:17,150
But actually, I get a lot of technical aspects in this course, so it's hard to say that this management course, again, but a lot of practice, you know, that's based on theory, the theory days.

23
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:23,110
So unless you understand the theory, then you can, you can put this into practice, right?

24
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:41,700
And this is an unusual oriented course, but, uh, I will use some Chinese to explain that particular today, as because I know that most students were not, um, well, to take it, even assets.

25
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,400
Will prepare some in terms of language and course, contents.

26
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,630
The course is, it's not that easy.

27
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,340
I gotta say, it's very difficult, right?

28
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,240
Because it combines management and technology.

29
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,010
We put it all together, and you're going to do a lot of exercise, right?

30
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,630
It is not, um, just actual management.

31
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:17,670
Not not at all. Right? Um, many of you, you you use English often, so I know it.

32
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:28,740
This is a natural fault. I would say, that because we don't, we don't have the English speaking environments that baby your daily life.

33
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,940
You don't use English often, right?

34
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:44,320
So this the situation, right? And we try to create this, ah, english speaking, and listening, rolling, even writing, right?

35
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:57,510
These are and create these environments because it is a global, you know, global competitions there by, particularly in your generation.

36
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,260
And even even though we can teach us in Chinese, no problem at all.

37
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,500
But eventually you're going to compete with many people from different country.

38
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,000
So that's why we have this mission.

39
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,420
As mission is to teach what to teach English.

40
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:25,910
Um, not focus on others. Teach English, teach the course in English.

41
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,670
Actually, I don't focus on English.

42
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:36,030
I focus on the contents. But English is also a tour right to make you familiar with this kind of

43
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,720
situation, that or someday, you got to listen, engage your listen.

44
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,040
They're listening to other people from different countries.

45
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:59,160
After you graduate, you go to encounter the situation, and you're going to have different students from around the The words are not this discourse, I know it.

46
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:06,120
But some of the courses we recruit, pleasure, recruits another foreigner come to our departments.

47
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:17,380
And genius is coming interdisciplinary. And yeah, so tower set ups are 2023.

48
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,300
Are we going to reach dealer language?

49
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:35,600
So with this kind of policy, so we are going to promote a lot of professor right to use English as a medium of teaching.

50
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,640
Right? So that is, that's the way.

51
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:47,700
Well, we want to enhance your English listening comprehension skills, right?

52
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:58,510
So if you cannot understand totally, then you know, that's okay, right?

53
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:06,130
But I hope that, to hope that day by day is going to enhance on your comprehension again.

54
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:14,520
And I said that this course is to do, I do S-A-D, that just but you got to practice it, right?

55
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:22,070
And I, and I also, um, instead the design thinking of the chorus, right?

56
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:31,020
Of course, design thinking that, um, well, it it is, um, knowledge sharing.

57
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,710
All right. If you understand more, share to your team members.

58
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:52,950
So we group you. So even though you choose your team members, but we have a couple of group, you study in a group, then you got a problem, you ask for your team members, or even T-A-M-E, right?

59
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,350
And you came on interrupt me.

60
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:16,720
Raise your hand. Ask question, order, ask, yes, the, um, the pace, you know, yeah, a kind of use a quick, quick way to to talk by so you can't, if you can't always your hand as still, mean, right?

61
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:23,070
So here you are, understanding participates in the course discussion, right?

62
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,710
And don't punctual. You come here now on time.

63
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:45,200
So that's the requirements. And the objective of the course is to make you understand that how system is created, right, how to initialize your ideal, and how to analyze this design it.

64
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:57,080
John Eventually we have that after the schools, that you understand that own system, so not just components, but how system media design.

65
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,500
Then I rephrase it by using Chinese What?

66
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:26,800
Sure? Yeah, you should dig a curtain on the curtain to show line.

67
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:48,770
In cities, world system sushi, they don't whole clean.

68
00:09:49,090 --> 00:10:01,310
Bartana City Improvement. Try now take a picture.

69
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:14,690
No number Hangzhou don't engage time to win.

70
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:21,350
On to the our race question on the monkey Freedom.

71
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,110

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,970
We're sure to show that to learn.

77
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:18,990
Okay, bangzhou, one meal. Um, take a machine on go.

78
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:32,190
Would you like? Shanghai. China is Resources from trunk class summit Lesbian church.

79
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:37,210

80
00:11:37,630 --> 00:12:00,820
Yeah, I'm instant. What you want?

81
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:08,410
Jiang Gong Xiang You t shirt in England?

82
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:27,310
Well, so she in England. Nine, some cold now, that's great.

83
00:12:35,460 --> 00:13:04,660
Three. Okay, oh, that we don't have time.

84
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:26,030
Jumped on far to three, bunny, the UK The leads.

85
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:37,910
Okay, um. Well, so you can't help yourself, before you come, you preview, right?

86
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,190
And discuss or ask question to your team members.

87
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,390
Of course, we kept T-A and me.

88
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,480
I have my office already. I'm talk about that, right?

89
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,420
So this is the objective, by the teaching objective.

90
00:13:51,480 --> 00:14:05,770
I hope that you, you know, that the whole system creates right and process, I, um, well, the the matter I use, right?

91
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:20,220
I the, well, the teaching matter can be been many kinds right er to use, interactive by communication.

92
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,970
So that's why I give you the the video.

93
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,850
Right? So the video is about active learning lines.

94
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:34,560
I hope you follow that active learning, because you are the main road to learn something, right?

95
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,020
So after learning, we are not going to use the passive way, traditional way.

96
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,050
Right? So I am not, I am not a knowledge trust major.

97
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,350
No, no, if I-I-I am that role, right?

98
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,020
That, um, you, you just pass the receive anything.

99
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,360
You don't have any feedback. I don't like that.

100
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,980
So you probably have very bright and brilliant ideas.

101
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,240
I wanted to hear from you, right?

102
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:16,460
And I also wanted to to know how much you have done the preparation so that that I wanted to use this kind of matter like part of that I will lecture by television.

103
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,680
I will, I will lecture that a new lesson.

104
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,570
And that you my, ah, compare about what you

105
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,150
already read and with my teacher.

106
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:37,270
All right, so probably some of that will solve your problem, or, um, raise you more question problem.

107
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,430
The expectation activity that's a focus

108
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,210
on a cure and activities that to facilitate HR Thinking.

109
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,580
HR Well, so it's quite normal, right?

110
00:15:50,740 --> 00:16:01,250
Very flexible stimulate that you're thinking and you want to participate in And this kind of way, I want to use secure activities, right?

111
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,010
So you got a preview, right?

112
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:10,950
Preview the readings or the chapters I-I assigned I for based on the surface.

113
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,770
Again, I hope that you come here on time.

114
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:19,370
Good is a punctuation. Punctuation. And you will come here.

115
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:24,630
I come here on time. Yeah, because that's your responsibility to come here on time.

116
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:30,430
But, you know, sometimes unexpectedly you might help, know, something that you will try.

117
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:38,850
You No, that? Um, well, just tell me that the late for a couple of minutes, such as this matter, right?

118
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:45,550
But, um, for some reason you cannot come, right, and let me know in advance.

119
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:55,190
Or you you praise or praise the application of leave for that kind of It is adjustable.

120
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:10,870
Reason is okay, so, uh, I'm going to evaluate your performance based on your participation by participation, and I'm going to assign to to examination.

121
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,910
I meet and and find an examination.

122
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,730
And you have teamwork to teamwork this to this.

123
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,710
Teamwork. Teamwork one and teamwork to are correlated.

124
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,920
Um, okay, so that's how I grade you.

125
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:32,770
So about a great policy, great in parts of how I greet you, how you vary your performance.

126
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:39,820
This one is about, um, the the letter, little, great letter s.

127
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:54,190
ABC Everybody little grades a plus if score 100 and ABCD until that's But about the participation, or participation?

128
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,680
You may get a price, right?

129
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,900
It depends on your contribution, contribution to to the course on that day, right?

130
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,840
So I'll probably, I think that, well, you answer is perfect, right?

131
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,290
Perfect as beyond my expectation, then that might give you a price.

132
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,200
That means you you got it for school, 100 for that week, right?

133
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:31,800
I'm already just answered yes, no, or very simple questions, and you got a basic C minus.

134
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:41,110
It means you pass. Right? When are you just sit still, do nothing, say nothing.

135
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:48,490
Then it's 50, around 50. Are you your absence?

136
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:59,550
Show up? Zero. A nice. Now you you have a personal living reason, right?

137
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,690
So that that is how I evaluate you.

138
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:10,120
Great Participation occupies the 21st of the grade, so it's a lot.

139
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:22,120
So participation is you usually sit without doing anything that well.

140
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:31,100
Any good habitats. Teamwork, teamwork are occupied 30, 30 %.

141
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,200
We have teamwork for one for 15.

142
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,190
The 30% meet And final examination is your personal right?

143
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:44,590
Is personal grades. So it's have that right.

144
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:51,660
So even though, um, you're perfect, you're pretty good at, ah, taking an examination.

145
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,520
Nobody can do that. It's 50, right?

146
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,170
You got 50, but you don't participate in your teamwork.

147
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:20,500
The teamwork, your member or the group leader, is going to give you very low great So so I hope that this course can encourage you, you know, to know how to cooperate with your team members and to know your responsibility, right?

148
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,550
Because I said that on that's a preparation for this course.

149
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:33,070
You come here with some questions, that that's good, because you prebuilt the resources I gave you, and they

150
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,910
would stimulate your your question before you come here.

151
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:43,870
Bye. You come here to to have some answer.

152
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:51,170
Um. Well, traditionally, on teacher is a knowledge transmitter.

153
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:51,230
Why?

154
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,330
It just said to do nothing.

155
00:20:53,490 --> 00:21:00,270
That is very easy for for the professor and student, because he just said, and I just talk, that's it.

156
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:12,360
I probably read the powerpoint. It's very easy, but for active learning, very hard to implement it, because your responsibility gets more you walk your world study role, right?

157
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:20,480
And I have to think about how to design my course for those parts well, or difficult.

158
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:31,350
But study shows that, um, this way, you know, student centers that can enhance your understand more than traditional one.

159

243
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,950
Teamwork, one presentation. We are going to use video, right?
