0
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,270
I'd like to take

1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,390
a picture.

2
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,070
And

3
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:34,490
I think that's that's the way it is, and that's the way it is, and that's the way it is.

4
00:00:41,330 --> 00:01:49,710
I'm going to you, and I'm going to take you with you, and I'm not sure if I'm the one, that's the one, that's the one, that's the one, that's the one, I'm going to be the one that's the one, that's the one, that's the one, that's the one Hey, teacher and classmate, we are Go on.

5
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:55,010
And David, this is our team member, tiffany.

6
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:02,260
If Dennis can a little more, peter if I and Scott.

7
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:13,060
Our topic is Intelligent Appliance. This is our content.

8
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,020
1st is introduction. So is a use case and use case discretion.

9
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,650
Then is a activity diagram sequence tiger and class.

10
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,790
Tiger loss is a be behavior.

11
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:32,920
Stay machine now and introduce our system.

12
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,180
Our project is to define a system of intelligent intelligence appliance.

13
00:02:43,560 --> 00:03:06,100
Is I-A-A small system. When user recedator, temperature and aircraft for the sensor, according to according to the data, the user can decide to turn on or turn off, turn off the devices, air conditioner and air pfas.

14
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,840
Also, the user can choose other model.

15
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:22,720
After that, the system will provide benchmark following use such as the temperature and air quality to turn on or turn off.

16
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:30,770
Then the system will besides those follow used to control devices for extent.

17
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:41,660
The temperature is money is 22 degrees, but increase to 29.

18
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:55,400
Eight meal. Our system will open air, conditional by the users, setting or not five use the temperature variation.

19
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:06,170
The development time is short, our technology is not very good, and we want to profile to eat user after we are done.

20
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:22,840
So we decide to adopted the face in environment mystology for for this, we can make the main function 1st and then lead the program execute.

21
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,650
If we need to edit new function or find improving function, we can update the program to make up for it.

22
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:41,250
Hope you so can understand 1st, 1st our system, then follow up to new ideal question.

23
00:04:51,970 --> 00:05:01,010
Okay, I'm Raymond. This part is use case diagram, and we choose intelligence applying system to be our project.

24
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:09,280
And this is our use case, diagram Intelligence Appliance System has four use cases, and there are two actors user and sensor.

25
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:17,890
The user has a relationship with control devices and too small, and the sensor has a relationship with client environment, data, control

26
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,030
devices and check devices. Connections are a relationship of crew.

27
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,250
The users start

28
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,490
the system, and it will check the connection 1st.

29
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:33,670
When the collection is successful, user can use the choose more function to select automatic or mono mode.

30
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:41,290
And in these two months, the sensor will be responsible for collecting environmental data and pass the data to the system.

31
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,890
This is the end of my part.

32
00:05:50,210 --> 00:06:06,850
Hi, I'm Tiffany. Now I'm going to introduce use case discretion On use case diagram, we choose collect environment data, use case to write use case description.

33
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,270
Its idea is one an important level is high poverty.

34
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:19,050
Actor is sensor. Use case type is detail and essential stakeholders.

35
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,130
And interest is that sensor wants to get temperature and air quality.

36
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:32,190
Birth description is that this use case describes how the system collect temperature and air quality.

37
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,890
It trigger every minute. And its type is internal.

38
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:47,560
This use case is association with sensor Normal flow of events.

39
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:54,690
1st users does the system, then system will do convention checking.

40
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:02,190
If check device connection is failed more than five times, then the system will shut down.

41
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,990
But before actually shut down, it will send notification to user.

42
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:16,600
If it is less than five times, then it will send notification to user and check connection again.

43
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:22,450
If it is success, then user can choose the minimum mode or automo.

44
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:30,790
Then after user choose the mode, the system receives data from the sensor.

45
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,260
Then system check out the model that the user chose.

46
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:52,020
If the mode is equal to manual, according to the environment data, the user can decide to turn on or turn off the air conditioner and air purifier.

47
00:07:52,470 --> 00:08:09,090
If the mode is equal to auto, based on the environment data we receive, according to the benchmark values, then the control unit will turn on or turn off the air conditioner and air purifier.

48
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,630
Hi, anyone? Next, I will introduce our activity diagram.

49
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:28,830
The activity diagram shows the interaction of the activity in the clear environment data use case.

50
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:38,470
At the beginning, the user will start the system, and then the system will connect the intelligent appliance and sensor at the same time.

51
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:45,050
After checking if the connection is successful, it will enter the two small stage.

52
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:54,650
If the connection checks fails more than five times, the system will be forced to shut down and return to the home page of the user's mobile phone.

53
00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:04,910
And if the failure is less than or equal to five times, a notification later will be sent to the user, and user will be asked to check again.

54
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:21,630
Hi, I am Peter. At the stage of truth, more, the user can choose between automatic and manual mode.

55
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:31,620
If the automatic mode is selected, the user need to beset the benchmark value condition, including the temperature and air quality status.

56
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:40,420
E.g., when a temperature benchmark value is set to 30 degrees, the air conditioner will be automatic, typically turned on.

57
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:48,960
In the next step, the system will receive the data from the sensor to judge the current temperature and air quality.

58
00:09:49,220 --> 00:10:06,230
The cover, that is the user, previously slave take the most automatic the system will be well compared with the data transmitted from the sensor to the benchmark value condition set by the user in advance.

59
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:17,790
If it matches, the system will automatically turn on or turn off the relevant intelligence appliance under the corresponding condition, although

60
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:23,820
we also send a message to inform the user which intelligence appliance the system has turned

61
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:39,420
on, over, turn off. Finally, the homepage of the system, information such as the current temperature and air quality status, as well as which connected intelligence appliances are on or off, will be displayed.

62
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,750
OK? This part is Secostiagram and Dennis.

63
00:10:49,910 --> 00:11:06,890
There are to report in this section, me and Scott and I will introduce the 1st health And we we have one user and six are object.

64
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:15,640
And we will show the interaction with user going and control and sensor air conditioner and air purifier.

65
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:40,020
Everyone in the college, call in college environment, data, process, process user, start up the system at 1st, then control control, check the connection with sensor when checker conditions and a film.

66
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:53,800
Then five times, and and before the system is completely shut down, and user will get a notification from going.

67
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:15,140
If the connection is normal, it will enter the station stage stage, and the user can select the model to be menu of automatic through the screen display.

68
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:24,750
By the going, the control will start temperature information and air quality status in korea's air in four through a sensor.

69
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,500
And then the control will confine the model use by the user.

70
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:57,740
Okay, I'm Scott. If the user choose the manual mode, the controller will pass it to the page, slept by the Green, and the user will choose whether to open the air conditioner and air purify through the screen display.

71
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:20,560
By way, if the user choose choose the automatically mode, the controller will collect the information of current air info and compare the temperature and air quality states set by the user to automatically turn on or turn off the air condition and air purify.

72
00:13:20,970 --> 00:14:05,570
After today, the controller returned the information to the queen and the user of ten After they the controller returned information to the GUI, and the user obtained the information through by the We finally, after the enter the system of the controller in shut down, it will return the temperature and air quality stay to the Greek, and we will display it to the users to obtain information.

73
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,370
Hi. And if now, I will introduce orcasta again.

74
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:28,920
In the photo, you can see all cats, dog have five cases control case to rent air information, cats, sensor cats, air purifier cats and air conditioner cats.

75
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:44,900
1st Control control case. This case, have temperature, air check, sensor, air purifier, air conditioner attributes, and have turned on or turn off air purified method.

76
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,000
Turn on or turn off air conditioning method.

77
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,480
These methods are let the user decide to turn on or turn off the devices.

78
00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:02,840
Then the control case will ask a purifier class over air conditioner cats to turn on or turn off.

79
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:09,880
So you can see control cats, air purified cats and air conditioner cats have these methods.

80
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,030
Get an

81
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:21,990
information method. The control case can call this method to ask sensor cats get the temperature and air quality.

82
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,090
So you can see a control case.

83
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,830
And since the case has this method, check device connection method,

84
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:42,460
this method in the control case is used to connect with sensor case, auto turn air conditioner method and autotton air.

85
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:54,020
PM fire method. These methods are lay the control can scale of data from the sensor case like it will compare with benchmark values.

86
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,450
If it's match, then the control cans will do these methods shut up.

87
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:15,020
MR If the connection is far more than five times, then the control case will do shut down method to kill device, slack mode and check mode.

88
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:26,820
2nd modern method is for user to seek out a manual mode, then the control class can check one more use a choose through check model method.

89
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:35,900
John to enter air information. Case these cats have temperature and air attributes.

90
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:43,670
Since a case, these cats have temperature and air attributes and have sensor method.

91
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:55,090
Get an information method. Hi, I'm Ken.

92
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,970
I'm talking about the behaviors the machine.

93
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,830
In our system, the basis class is a sensor.

94
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:17,950
So steam machine is written with a sensor, which will 1st establish a connection with a controller, and then collecting data and sending data to the controller.

95
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:24,320
After it, you will finish. Thanks for listening.

96
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:40,720
Thank you for your presentation. And I have a couple of questions about your project, right?

97
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:51,260
So, um, you said your project wanted to control the devices manually, order automatically.

98
00:17:51,680 --> 00:18:00,700
Right? How many devices you want to control to to Yes.

99
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,890
What? What are the two? Air condition and air purify?

100
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,090
Air Conditioner an air purifier? Yes.

101
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,460
Okay, so that is your project, right?

102
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,100
So air conditioner and air purify.

103
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:28,270
So you have sensor, right? And this sensor keeps sensing, detecting, or can stop?

104
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,210
Yes. What would what do mean?

105
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:38,870
Yes, it keeps sensing, detecting the the air, penalty and temperature.

106
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,650
Keep doing this, or stop it.

107
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:51,300
You can detail a temperature and keep detecting.

108
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,430
Yes. Keep detecting without without stopping.

109
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:06,160
Keep doing that? Yes, yes, I shall keep detecting, then see your behavior.

110
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,740
Stay machine, your behaviors. Dimension is disconnect.

111
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,540
So that is a sensor. They should keep detecting.

112
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,900
Okay, so I-I don't quite understand about this.

113
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:28,260
And you have only two devices you use phase development methodology.

114
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:37,120
You said that? Well, they are the most important one we want to design at 1st.

115
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:42,420
That's the rest. Then we're going to probably add.

116
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,790
But you only have two, right?

117
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:51,790
Two devices. What about the plan for the next version?

118
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:58,770
So the function, unit ia system, for function?

119
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,080
What function is the 1st version?

120
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:20,760
Or order system? It's the 1st phase, because that's quite simple.

121
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,830
I very use face.

122
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,740
We will add a new device,

123
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:37,750
new device, you add new device, then it's still easy listen.

124
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,270
Choose mode is too small a function,

125
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:56,620
because you describe it in the collect in environment data, and you can see correct environment data by the sensor actor, without any user involvement.

126
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:03,540
But your description describe correct environment, daytime user.

127
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:12,130
But I don't see an association between you, sir, and the function.

128
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,610
I see your use case description.

129
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,260
Collect Collect environment data a year.

130
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:37,820
This is user by user. Start system every time.

131
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,720
Let this pictures. If you have this intelligent province.

132
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:54,470
All right, user enter the room, probably has on the cell phone, you get, well, I need to use the system.

133
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:00,620
What what about the sensor? The sensor Take rest or keep detecting?

134
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,940
You said, keep detecting the temperature and purified.

135
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:11,060
Then every time we need to start the system, this start system.

136
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:39,040
Or you just do that. If we use automatic mode, then keep detecting and then turn it on, because says, gotta maintain the temperature, and then user turn it off, turn it off, or is manual, then user turn it off.

137
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,340
I don't see any intelligence. Well, this is intelligent.

138
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,190
We start the system and then collect the information.

139
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,490
Probably, you have your cell phone.

140
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:57,370
Your cell phone shows at the temperature is three and humanity, ryan oil.

141
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:01,750
Well, the air is not so clean, right?

142
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:12,290
It sound quality, so you you get value, and then decide to chen on excessive intelligence.

143
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:23,310
I don't see its intelligence. I cannot get it.

144
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:30,980
And user control, device, check, device connection, the function.

145
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:37,850
What about the intelligence? I-I really don't don't know your your point about this project.

146
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:51,050
So can what working? Say that if, if you want to, then I want to ask you a question, right?

147
00:23:51,850 --> 00:24:07,410
If we need to add more devices, then you only to turn it on, or for we add the device, what kind of design pattern you're going to use?

148
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,850
Try to use design pattern structure to describe it.

149
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,270
Because you only need to control, right?

150
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:30,150
Probably use your cell phone as controller in making intelligence.

151
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:44,300
I don't see the intelligence part can answer me about your face development methodology and your idea about this, because I cannot see any intelligence or innovative idea.

152
00:24:44,720 --> 00:25:11,500
Nothing general can answer this. You want to make intelligence, let me know at right And if you want to add more devices, think about any design pattern, structure you can.

153
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,900
You can use it and make it intelligent.

154
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:30,580
Because I don't see your idea for for your project, anything you wanted to to explain otherwise.

155
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,230
The 2nd assignment, you got to make very big modification, because I don't see any sense

156
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,790
what this

157
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:50,630
can next him.

158
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:58,830
I go to, please go to

159
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:35,520
Thank you for your presentation. Teacher only.

160
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:24,440
Oh, maybe So it's very test.

161
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,780
Okay, so good evening, everyone. We are good too.

162
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:35,500
Today, we're going to introduce automatic local system.

163
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:45,370
Before the reports begins, I want to talk about why we choose it as our topic.

164
00:27:47,170 --> 00:28:04,930
When we were discussing, we all, we already some students who ore the teacher took a local again during the class.

165
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:09,710
This situations leads to us wasting time.

166
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:21,540
So get down to business. Let me start with introduction.

167
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:14,510
So, oh, when the student is entering or leaving the classroom, the facial recognition system will re recognize the student.

168
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:21,810
After that, according to the curriculum schedule.

169
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:30,490
We important before determine whether it is time for class.

170
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:56,740
Based on this result, record students absent after status next benefit for user.

171
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,900
For students, the rate of absence will be lower.

172
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:09,540
Not like digital local system, which can be cracked by classmates.

173
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:18,400
Moreover, radar Local system also can be treated by an emulator.

174
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,000
And the last one is QR corocal system.

175
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,670
I have to say, it's so terrible for students.

176
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:33,630
For present students, it's difficult to skin.

177
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:40,330
Unfortunately for absent students, it still can be cracked by classmates.

178
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:52,230
Next benefit for the teacher. It can save time and make the teacher focus on

179
00:30:52,560 --> 00:31:01,110
the class from another perspective. It can avoid the teacher from getting

180
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,710
upset by the absent

181
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,150
students.

182
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,240
I'm UK, I will introduce Methodology 1st.

183
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:28,280
We only have few times to do this work, so structures development is not our consideration.

184
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:38,850
Next, we don't have related professional knowledge, and we also need to learn other courses.

185
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:43,770
Daily meeting is not suitable for our team.

186
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:49,950
So XB and Strong are on city last.

187
00:31:50,370 --> 00:32:16,110
This work is just a demo, and we don't have a lot of time to do it, so we choose prototype prototyping I'm talking about.

188
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,970
You start good, and this diagram is wrong.

189
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:31,250
I'll talk about what here is wrong later.

190
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,330
They take students, is our main function.

191
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:50,330
They take students and recording the absence, 1st human detection, identify whether someone has placed the door, if the human detection is successful, passing with those subsequent action.

192
00:32:50,730 --> 00:33:09,580
Camera sensor is a camera. Let's take image for human detection as facial recognizing monitor displays the image culture by camera sensor database is starving data.

193
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:33,570
The private PVD is wrong. We found that it is not comfort to our distress if the human dictation is fair and Israel not do down to the here.

194
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,830
So we change a new diagram.

195
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,780
Next week. Hi, my name is Leo Nice.

196
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:06,850
We going to talking about a description in normal For 1st, the system will detect the students who enter in classroom, and recognition sub for or some four will be performed.

197
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:34,490
The recognition will do a far release following action, use human detect to recognize where to have any student is passing to confirm facial recognition to success of not effect recognition, it's success.

198
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,970
Far floor will keep going to next normal floor.

199
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:44,390
In face recognition, it's failed. Goes to alternated for one.

200
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:57,030
In alternative for one, the camera will capture the student pictures and send it to the teacher s email.

201
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:07,350
This next of normal floor is according to class timetable to the design.

202
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,570
Now is cost time or not.

203
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,940
Judge student student is entering or lifting the classroom.

204
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:31,550
If student is entering, I will do except for two If students let off for curse of of a ten minute, say it.

205
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,390
Say that student workers state is late.

206
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:45,710
If student it's late for more than half a class, say that the student record state is absent.

207
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,760
If the student is leaving, then suffer free

208
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:56,520
is will be performed when students live in the class.

209
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,070
Set the student

210
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:18,160
state to record numbers time. Next step is when the cars already and end, then some four, four will be performed.

211
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,230
After finish, the class will put do s lancas time.

212
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:27,270
If student lanks time, often learn one 1st.

213
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,560
Then let's let the student record record is excused.

214
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:42,750
If students on cost time of them want half, then the student record record is absent.

215
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:57,390
Okay, we we all show the activity diagram by the PDF.

216
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:08,570
Yes. Okay. I'm Eric. I will use this activity diagram to introduce this system.

217
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:15,830
All the system has to do is check.

218
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:32,780
And we will post camera at the door of the cartoon to continues detect faith and human figure and her human figure and face Is that detect?

219
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,170
We will identify the the face?

220
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:41,770
Yes, we Tomato will be needed.

221
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,600
Here is one and this one.

222
00:37:45,020 --> 00:38:01,720
And when we successfully computer identification, we will change the state of the student changes, changes students instead of student.

223
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:30,350
And that or absent? Yes. And we have a mistake in here, a if a class is now over, yet it should be a error from here back to here.

224
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:36,340
To continue detail the human figure and face, yes.

225
00:38:37,500 --> 00:39:03,930
And we have to avoid some big guy who want to sneak in or thinking or without being discovered, or some students who who are recur as absent for things to identify, yes, your happiness is failed.

226
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:09,530
Yeah, we will tell a picture in India and send it to the future.

227
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:18,600
And after the class, we will come come the long class time.

228
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:47,290
And if the time is over, all over of the class, we will let a student be absent, and and after all of the counting an hour record is done, we will let all of the students record that the accident.

229
00:39:47,450 --> 00:40:12,230
Thank you. Okay, hi. I'm how y.

230
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,990
Now I'm introduced the sequence diagram.

231
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:29,510
After the deadline, we have some change process the end of the lifeline, like this, because we mistake its meaning, so we delete it.

232
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:38,800
Then then t says, G-I may be a hardware interface.

233
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:49,110
So we turned camera. We turned the camera job, we turned came out to behind the student to be our U-Y.

234
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:55,010
The last is Self Cool Tuesday.

235
00:40:55,170 --> 00:41:09,470
Medical mistakes, of course, usage. So we changed starts to recognize the after human detection, it will co recognizer to start recognize moreover show image will combine with the sand

236
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:30,130
image to send and show and check if and check if it class time, become to call by recognizer.

237
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:54,300
Otherwise, human Detection Execution appearance. This other ten classmates tell us it doesn't draw a full lifeline, which works wrong continuously, only show the parts where both are related.

238
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,960
Okay, let's the change of our sequence.

239
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:16,910
Let's run the system 1st students through the door and camera co human coachman detections, dot detect and detection could recognise historic mice.

240
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,550
Then the recognizer request the info to database.

241
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:34,780
We use, we use return because we think student info is the most important used dictate student and which is the most important function to our system.

242
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:55,510
After that, send photo, use book barking, barking, because we think the photo may be Stanfield, but detects should be real time and prompt, so if it didn't get right away, we throw did the same argument.

243
00:42:55,670 --> 00:43:05,700
Send image, and the show is talking to after after that.

244
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:18,800
There's a lot of judgment to record those student state state, but the activity just mentioned, so I passed it.

245
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:22,950
I'd like to hand over to Stephen to explain class diagram.

246
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:30,540
Hi, I am Stephen, and there are six class in the diagram.

247
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:52,450
The student class is to determine if the student goes through the door or not, and the state controller class will check their class name and determine if the student go go in or out, call that ex time and record attend, absent late, excuse students.

248
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:57,210
All of the information will stand to the database place.

249
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:03,450
They recognize class is to recognize the student.

250
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:14,250
If it for you, will go to the camera class to take a photo and send it to the database place, then email to the teacher.

251
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:25,220
It recognized success. It will go to the database close to protect the students each time and change the students date.

252
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,170
And the monitor is to show a live image.

253
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:49,710
An Aquitta is talking about behaviour.

254
00:44:49,870 --> 00:45:03,010
Steam machine Winners system will set on deten detention and star winners student to the town.

255
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:09,990
I have in adding identify reader.

256
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:20,890
They are Record and image. If you can recognize 700, recognize it, she said.

257
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:27,090
And recognize if you can can recognize is bell system.

258
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:38,790
Leader Receive talking bottle and photographing child again.

259
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:49,320
the recording and recording. Any class is over, the teacher will interrupt the system.

260
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,390
Thank you for listening. Have a good day.

261
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,230
What your

262
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:15,790
project is? And, oh my God, project

263
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,380
I really don't know how we

264
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:31,080
ask question. This is, give me a break for now.

265
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:45,840
I don't see Team one and Team two can conduct 2nd assignment based on your after you not even close.

266
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,700
So I-I don't know how to help you.

267
00:46:52,190 --> 00:47:04,040
This is another project. So I said it is an, oh my God, project, really?

268
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,060
It's not. Is it another project?

269
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,740
So I-I intend to interrupt you.

270
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:17,160
No, no, meat, but it's okay, let you know, finish your presentation.

271
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:24,350
But I gotta tell you that, no, not even close everything.

272
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:30,810
How can I help you? Anyway, thank you for your presentation.

273
00:47:30,970 --> 00:48:04,700
That's a lot of problem. Let's go through to help everything.

274
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:23,580
Or they have good perspectives, we win.

275
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,400
Hello everyone. We are group three, and my name is Jack.

276
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,160
This is our teamwork. Wang Smart Teach.

277
00:48:30,160 --> 00:49:10,090
And our team member is j Alan, eric, danny, jeff, richard, edward, tina and Erin introduction, our system will collect the data of generate ditch in various places to judge whether the generate efficiency efficiency is too low, or there is a flooding, and notify the relevant personnel to deal with it.

278
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:26,380
And this is our contest. We use prototyping 1st car.

279
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:39,160
Cost useful, having to continuously demonstrate and correct features that need to be implemented safely, stay within without without footing, cost the wrong direction.

280
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:47,430
That's saving cost. Uncomocated project. Our system is not a large and complex system.

281
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:52,210
Short time, the time limit is about three months, not a lot of time.

282
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:58,250
Rapid repeatedly convert the design direction.

283
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:02,430
Here we are using red, not agile.

284
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:09,660
We have a mistake, because the come condition of the challenge equipment is different in each place.

285
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:17,440
The design will be modified according to the conditions that often occur in the In the place, e.g.

286
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:21,020
it is often flooded with heavy rain or damage.

287
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,020
System is easy to block incorporation.

288
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:32,280
It is necessary to confront the need step by step, to the local area and the final reach and finally reach the consensus.

289
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,200
And high school and high schedule.

290
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:43,070
Visibility a need to be complete within a limited time schedule.

291
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:50,730
Compassibility is important. I am Jack.

292
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:53,210
This is our use case diagram.

293
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:58,050
We have five use case Monitor the train.

294
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:04,740
Hello, data from sensor and show whether the journey is in good condition.

295
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,390
Judge problem, use

296
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:14,350
the data collected from the sensor to just possible costs of floating in the area near

297
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:26,230
guter won the problem. One environmental potential agency that there is a floating problem in this area.

298
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:38,880
So problem. Let's find a chief of village or cleaning staff to solve the problem according to the cause of the flooding.

299
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,520
So here is our use case description.

300
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:56,390
1st use case name is Power Judgment and Solution.

301
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:09,280
In the 2nd impartuity is the Environment Protection Agency to know the situation of our ditch on system.

302
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,860
In our primary item is Immoding Protection Agency.

303
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:31,480
And trigger is when census taste value reach a red level in our precondition.

304
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,640
Is something star in this show, then boy is too heavy.

305
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:50,730
That teacher can have food. And there is, they are three, number four, and somebody is speaking the 1st two is, no, I don't what label things of what four things, god away.

306
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:55,230
Signal. And look, you see you're very single now.

307
00:52:55,430 --> 00:53:07,710
And and learn the ju then the system will charge your problem.

308
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:30,380
However, however, the problem is the the suburb, one in several, two, one in the notice will be show on the screen in saying, professional to solve a problem will all be performed.

309
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:43,480
A lesson the next is activity diagram.

310
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,980
In our active diagram, it shows that how the system works.

311
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:49,570
Start with the amount of condition.

312
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:53,710
If the system not find any problems, you will do this action repeatedly.

313
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:58,280
If it does find problems, it will consider it is some stocking.

314
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,640
Then the season will ask cleaning steps to go troubleshooting.

315
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:17,210
After that, if John John g efficient efficiency still bad, the system will call environmental Protection Agency to solve it, lest the result will be return and saved.

316
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:34,060
Real truly progress. This is our sequence diagram.

317
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:43,160
The actor has Environment Protection Agency, chief of village and cleaning staff.

318
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:51,420
Next, we will divide into three parts to explain how the smart ditch works.

319
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,940
1ST sensor controller, mountain level, sensor and flow sensor.

320
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:03,610
And then they look for problems from But Jane, then you will return problems to sensor controller.

321
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:24,840
If there is no problem, this processor will always run, I'm Richard, we you see optional fragment.

322
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:33,780
When sensor finds problem, then sensor will send order to sister, and system will show warning on green and notice chief.

323
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:50,810
Then we use the alternative fragment when chief finding it is a serious problem to feel, call the Environmental Protection Agency to that clean step to declining the trend and return the problem information.

324
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:56,710
Otherwise, chief will clean the drain and return the problem information by himself.

325
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:11,270
When John is all clean, system controller will turn any problem to force, and system will show all fine on the ground.

326
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:20,460
Oh, my name is Danny, and that is our class diagram at the beginning of our system.

327
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:52,330
And deep manager functions hold by system are harmonizing different part of the market, such as sensor going and deep manager following this, sorry, following the Deep Manager responsible for communicating with database, while the resources need to write in American And is our sensor controller.

328
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:59,610
Sensor controller is used to control all sensor that need to be used in the system, including flow, sensor and level.

329
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:10,940
Sensor Less is going GUI is mainly used to display message and is divided into send the interface and report interface.

330
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:24,900
Hi, I'm Eric. This is our behaviors that machine.

331
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:32,630
I will extend this part with the whole system.

332
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,060
At the beginning, the system will start 1st.

333
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:51,950
After start up, the style will change to monitoring the ditch, and all sensors will start mandatory less Once the sensor finds any problem, the relevant people are called in to deal with it.

334
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:57,660
At the same time, the stay will change to waiting for a result data.

335
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:04,740
When the results are returned to the sensor, the system saves the results to the database.

336
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:13,930
The final steps will change to the display state, and it is up to the system to continue mandatory.

337
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:22,110
This is our teamwork. One. Thank you for listening.

338
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:32,520
The Well, this is a no no, no project.

339
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,510
The complexity, it's beyond your ability to deal with that.

340
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,930
So it's not a right topic.

341
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:45,240
You cannot deal with that. Too big.

342
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,460
You know, you're not able to do this.

343
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:54,740
You got to change topic. Guess all the way.

344
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,600
I when I do through that.

345
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:04,000
No, it's not acceptable, because you cannot do there is.

346
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,000
I cannot agree with that. All right, thank you for your presentation next.

347
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:59,870
Thank you. I see.

348
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:05,510
Hello everyone. We are grateful. Today we will talk about our project, encouraging

349
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,490
course. Rick. This is Contents, and I'm Danny.

350
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:14,560
The 1st far is introduction in Taiwan.

351
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:22,860
The frequent rains cause as many troubles the lakes get, where on the balcony is one of them.

352
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:31,080
So we decided to make a intelligent coursework for people who living in the running place, or who often need to go on.

353
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,580
It will keep the cause from getting away.

354
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,900
This is comparison between encouraging cars wreck and ordinary clothes.

355
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:44,960
Wreck concentrate. Intanging clothes. Reck can automatically concentrate cause.

356
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:50,430
Any encouraging clothes reckon has the only to prevent the cause from getting away.

357
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:57,030
Clothes something. it can help us get the start of the course in real time.

358
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:03,460
Remote control With the app, user can remotely control the cross wreck.

359
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:30,120
The army is equipped with raindrop sensor with because intanging cross wreck is used on the balcony with the roof, we decided the Army to be vertical to help the cross avoid splashing rain when the rain is too heavy, when the rain is too heavy, the army will automatically offer user can also manually open it through the app.

360
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:39,410
The app we decide, can clearly hang out a larger time set, take the course time, and remind the user when the time is up.

361
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:46,850
It can also cooperate with Western and humidity sensor to help us get the starts of the cause.

362
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:54,400
It can also use concentrate close button to lay the cross wreck automatically concentrate Close.

363
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,270
This is ending of my part.

364
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:05,270
I'm heady. Next, I will introduce our methodology.

365
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:12,100
Our methodology is gone. Here are some reasons why we choose it.

366
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:15,140
1st, we are smoking, only have nine people.

367
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:18,300
2nd, we are a beginner in citizen development.

368
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:24,700
3rd, because we have only three to four months, school is suitable for short term development.

369
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:30,910
1st, we have clear product requirements, and need to get started quickly.

370
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:39,690
Last, we need to iterate better encouragement product features one by one, get feedback and adjust direction.

371
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:54,190
But have frequent meetings. Each team member knows exactly what responsibilities are, and tries to complete the back luck in each spring so that we can be sure the project is on track.

372
01:02:54,530 --> 01:03:01,430
We use spring review to get feedback from skateholders on the output and operation.

373
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:11,100
Afterwards, each team member get opinions from outside, and we can get star improving items from next spring.

374
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,440
So this is why we choose score.

375
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:21,130
Hi, I'm Cara. Now we talk about your case.

376
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:28,220
Diagram Open earning use raindrop sensor and waste sensors to determine the amount of rainfall.

377
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:31,910
When the rain is heavy, the onion will open automatically.

378
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:38,110
When the rain is light, the egg will notify the user whether to manually open the onion.

379
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:45,940
Check out status use this sensor because you need to recall the weight and humidity data regularly.

380
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:57,290
From this data, we cannot correct status of the work of the cause and then decide whether to open the army collect clothes.

381
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:08,700
Will use the weight and humidity data to determine whether to notify the user to collect the costs, or any will automatically collect the cost to one side.

382
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:18,480
Cross collection standard is determined according to weight and humidity difference recorded by the weight and humidity senses during drawing time.

383
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:23,930
When the users start to hang close, the weight and humanity will be recorded.

384
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:27,930
The weight and humanity will continue to decrease with time.

385
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:34,390
When the weight and humidity no longer change, the system will automatically collect the close to one side.

386
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:41,780
Next. Hi, I'm Alex. How far I'm going to talk about use case description?

387
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:49,040
We choose open only to describe, because it's the most important function of our project.

388
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:53,910
I will introduce the overfield relationship and full of events.

389
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:58,930
1st part, it's easy to see the name ID.

390
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:03,810
Importantly for in primary it and its type is detailing essential.

391
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:12,430
There are three stake holders and interest 1st user wants to use and only to prevent calls from being spread with rainwater.

392
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:18,780
Next, raindrop sensor detects whether it is raining and determine the rainfall is heavy or light.

393
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:19,390
Last

394
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:22,300
one, what sensor detect the cause weight?

395
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,120
Then I

396
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,240
will describe it briefly this use case.

397
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:37,830
According to the rainfall and cost data, decide whether to open the only when user has a cause on our cost rick, it will be triggered and triggers.

398
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:49,140
Type is external. Next, open only has association relationship with three actors user ranger sensor and weight sensor.

399
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:53,230
It also has extend relationships with another use case.

400
01:05:53,490 --> 01:06:09,150
Checkout status. The following is main Part number four of event.

401
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:13,590
After user hands a cause, her wet sensor will detect weight.

402
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:24,290
To get initial weight. If we sensor has detected weight, the floor will go to step four, otherwise a few will go to the end.

403
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:27,390
Step four. Her range of sensor detection.

404
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:30,710
If it is raining the floor will go to step six.

405
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,000
In contrast, a firm will go back to step two.

406
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:45,360
Step six, the white sensor detects weight again, because we need to know the change in cause weight.

407
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:52,130
Then if the rainfall is light and cause weight didn't increase, the suffer one will be performed.

408
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:57,540
In this condition, the app will notice user.

409
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,800
The user can check cross status.

410
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:04,040
If user wants to open the only, the floor will go to step eight.

411
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,560
On the contrary, the floor will go back to step two.

412
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,400
Let's go back to step seven.

413
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:14,320
If a rainfall is heavy, all the cost weight increased.

414
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,480
Her sub photo will be performed.

415
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:27,190
In this case, the app will send a notification to open it, on it and forward.

416
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:37,470
Go to step eight. Step eight, the system open.

417
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:46,600
Stick. Only after that user can check whether it is still running and decide press cause button or not.

418
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:50,280
If user press the close button, the floor will go to the end.

419
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,160
However, the floor will go back to step nine.

420
01:07:53,580 --> 01:08:01,890
My party is over. Hello, I'm Bunny Pa Far.

421
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:04,070
I will talk about activity. Diagram.

422
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:23,400
We star activity diagram. At the initial node, user hands up the cause, and white sensor begins to detect weight, and then goes to the decision Not If there is white on the onion, the activity goes down to detect rain, but if it is weightless, our activity will stop.

423
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:27,000
Here. Now goes to our 2nd decision.

424
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:33,990
Not if the raindrop, sensor detect no rain, return to detect weight, and the system continue to judge the way.

425
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:43,010
But if raindrops, sensor detection, the wet sensor will execute again, goes through our 3rd decision node.

426
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:56,790
If the rainfall is less and the weight of cloth is no different between 1st and 2nd detection, the system will send a message to the user, and the user can immediately check course status and choose whether to open on it.

427
01:08:56,950 --> 01:09:02,680
At this time, if user doesn't choose open, only the activity will go back to detect weight.

428
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,440
There are two ways to open the army.

429
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:09,540
The 1st, its user choose open only.

430
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:19,600
The 2nd, if the rainfall is heavy or the weight of cloth is increased, the system will send open message to your user, and the only will open.

431
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:26,350
After open on it, user can check rent status and decide when to turn off.

432
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:32,250
Only At any time, when user press the closed button, the activity diagram will end.

433
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,780
My part is off. Hi, I'm Amelia.

434
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:41,740
Sister and I are going to talk about our sequence dialogue.

435
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:47,070
We choose to describe the most important parts.

436
01:09:47,230 --> 01:10:00,390
Open only the play, sparked in red on what we have modified 1st When the user starts to use the cost record for the 1st time, the user needs to make a connection.

437
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:07,110
The user will click the connect button and connect half bus of the clothes rick.

438
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:19,670
Then the user enters the wifi name and pays war to be given to the close rig and the close wreck control will receive the information and request the wifi to do the connecting.

439
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,460
If the connection failed, a failed message is displayed and

440
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,320
escalopy the user to enter it again.

441
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:27,870
If the

442
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:41,380
connection is successful, the main view of the application will be displayed, the system will start to enter the detention phase.

443
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:44,960
These stations are continuous, so writer it's in a loop.

444
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:54,070
When the system is in Canada state, it can work normally when detecting the user can still operate the clothes rick.

445
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:58,770
So here we use parallel in order to know whether the user is hanging close.

446
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:16,630
Now, the West failure must be greater than the usual, so after debating the weight, cross wreck control will determine whether it is the state of paying close a user is having close, raindrop, humidity, weight will detect and store the value in a database.

447
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:22,190
After that, we will judge to conditions to change room for status.

448
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:25,630
The 1st judgment basis is rainfall.

449
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:33,500
We will experiment and find a rainfall video that will not be spread on the clothes.

450
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:36,660
In most cases, the order is the weight.

451
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:42,650
If the waste of the clothes increase, its means that the clouds are sprayed with red.

452
01:11:42,730 --> 01:12:00,660
When rainfall is greater than the assist rainfall of the waiter increase, changing force status to heavy when rainfall is equally rule changing for status to no rain when it is Other conditions changing for status too little fine.

453
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,600
Here is the process of condition to detention.

454
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:06,840
It is up to trace time to describe a rest.

455
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:16,790
Hi, my name is Trista. Now I'm going to introduce the rest of our sequence diagram.

456
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:42,830
OK? At the same time of detection, the if the connection status is true, the look fragment will execute the following Two options are used to determine whether the oning is open when Hancock status is true and open only status is false.

457
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:53,280
If the rainfall status is heavy, the clothes right controller will let the only open.

458
01:12:53,500 --> 01:13:00,920
When the only is successfully open, it will return a success message to the close right controller.

459
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:10,290
The crosswalk controller will likely show the open message, and the open only status will change to true and be updated.

460
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:17,220
This option is used when the rainforest status is little.

461
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:21,470
If user has not been notified of the right message.

462
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:31,260
Iran, the controller will likely show the red message to notify user like it is running.

463
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:39,560
Now, this option is used when the user wants to open the onion.

464
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,720
User needs to click the open button.

465
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:51,140
When they want to open Langui will send the open message to the close right controller to open the owning.

466
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:55,510
If the only is opened, it will return the success message.

467
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,630
Language will show the open message to let user know it.

468
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:06,540
The close will controller will change and update the open only status to true.

469
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:19,770
This option is used when the open only status is true and user wants to close the only user needs to click the close oning button.

470
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:25,270
Then we will send a close message to the close right controller to close the owner.

471
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:29,640
If the only is close, it will return the success message.

472
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,720
Language will show the close message to notify you, sir.

473
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:39,800
The closer controller will change and update the open only status to force.

474
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:50,400
This option is used when user wants to check the close status, usually needs to click the check button.

475
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:54,280
Language will request the close status data.

476
01:14:54,670 --> 01:15:03,310
The close red controller will get the rainfall, weight and humidity records from database and return this record.

477
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:10,910
User can see these records and their record time on the going, so they can decide whether to open

478
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:14,740
across the only according to this record.

479
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,110
This is our

480
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:23,920
sequence diagram. Hello and you. The next part to introduce is the class diagram.

481
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:27,190
I will illustrate the function of each class.

482
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,880
The 1st is the user interface.

483
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:36,860
The class is responsible for the communication between the user and system, e.g.

484
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:44,650
allowing users to check the statues of growth in real time, such as close weight, environment, humidity.

485
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:54,590
It can also notify users when it runs, whether the only is open or closed, remind the user that it is time to collect the clothes.

486
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:04,340
Cause re controller. It controls the flow of the entire system, and it is the core part of the system.

487
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:10,460
It receives user operations from the GI and controls each class from it.

488
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:18,060
You can know the statues of hanging clouds, rainfall, connect teen and only statues.

489
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,940
Next is the child class of the controller.

490
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:31,340
These classes control different sensors. Respectively, raindrop can detect the rainfall and get the rainfall value.

491
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:34,640
Weight can detect weight and get the wet value.

492
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,780
Humidity can detect the humidity and get the humidity value.

493
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:44,320
We will store the data of these sensors in data pits from subsequent judgment.

494
01:16:46,600 --> 01:17:04,670
Wifi is responsible for connecting to the Internet through The only class we can control the appointment and clothing of only collect is the part that controls the cross re collection when the user uses the automatic collection function.

495
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:10,770
These cars will be called The above is an introduction to the class diagram.

496
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:19,740
Hi, I'm Carlen. Now I'm going to introduce part a behavior state machine.

497
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,520
This is behavior steam machine of the ironing.

498
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:26,700
The only is one of the most important parts of our clothes rake.

499
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:35,580
And we can see that the only is created, and the stay will be closed, then the the only will open automatically.

500
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:37,800
Any state will change to open.

501
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:53,530
Then only if the sensor shows that rainbow status is equal to little app will show a message to you, sir.

502
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:59,070
If you should check the open only button, then the only state will change to open.

503
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:08,130
If you use Clean your clothes, close only button, then if they will return to close.

504
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:10,430
Listen the end of our presentation.

505
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:30,990
Thank you for listening. Um, I don't see it.

506
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:36,170
Particle of your project is it often rains.

507
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:39,850
You can have a dryer. I stop everything, right?

508
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:46,760
It often rains. Then you want to design this open arm.

509
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:55,230
It's a Keep it open. What do you want to every don't see is practical, really.

510
01:18:55,230 --> 01:19:02,870
He said, when the rain is a happy rain and open it, it's too late, right?

511
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:09,220
Then you have the rope, the wreck to sense the weight, right?

512
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:14,820
Since the weight. And what about the the bluetooth?

513
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:18,100
Where? Where are you? Where are the user?

514
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:25,660
If you are away from from the sensor, how can you get this signal at home?

515
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:28,810
When you're at home, then you can do this by yourself.

516
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:41,470
I don't see this kind of design his markets know, who is going to to buy this.

517
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:45,630
But is this intelligence? I really don't know it.

518
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:51,850
You know, you have a cross wreck, according to the wide broadcast.

519
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,280
Now you want to spend that today?

520
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:58,180
You know, it rains, so we don't, we don't put a store room.

521
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:05,250
You want to hang your laundry outside, then it's going to have an orange.

522
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:12,700
I really don't think it's practical.

523
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:14,310
And

524
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:30,070
just say, said, you said you were, you introduction the oven rings a use the dryer, I can stop everything.

525
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:33,550
So any question I already don't see is practical.

526
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:56,280
According to your activity diagram, I see you the way you judge is little rain or heavy rain is by the weight.

527
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:09,910
But if, but I think it is, when you detect is heavy rain, that mean your cause is already very, very, very Wait.

528
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:17,160
So I think it's not possible to use weights to determine is little or heavy?

529
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:26,090
Yes, and practical. And your behavior?

530
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:33,610
Steam machine, uh, is the on you choose all in this case.

531
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:44,410
But is this is your most compass class, or okay, maybe you don't?

532
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:49,270
Is this is your more compass class?

533
01:21:52,710 --> 01:22:12,960
Okay, it's okay. Hey teacher. Can we answer a question?

534
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:17,620
Sure. OK about the activity diagram?

535
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:25,690
Tell me that's on. Why do you have this idea?

536
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,910
It is not practical at all.

537
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:31,170
What do you think the value of this project?

538
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:43,150
Our use is means, who doesn't have time to collect cost immediately when it rains so you're away from the home?

539
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:49,190
The brutal They cannot detect that long if you have that.

540
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:55,980
No, that's impractical. This is too late when you got the message.

541
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,200
If it is, no, this is not practical.

542
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:06,430
And if today, no, we the the weather.

543
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:08,610
You know that it's going to rain.

544
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:09,990
You're not going to do that.

545
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:18,170
We we have the weather forecast, so we can forecast the weather.

546
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:20,930
It's going to rain. So you're not going to do that.

547
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:35,520
And you get to invest a lot to have this device, the rack a student thing, it's open the the army.

548
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:50,530
This is often that the old way, then we solve the problem because the costs need some to sunshine, yet sunshine in sunshine.

549
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:57,990
Well, um, no, I think we we can prevent that from happening.

550
01:23:58,070 --> 01:24:04,330
And I said that if you want to use Bluetooth, then you're away from home.

551
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:11,340
No, you cannot accept. Can have this signal.

552
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:28,070
And we put clothes rack on balcony, you're balcony, right?

553
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,850
If it is some balcony, you should balcony now.

554
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:34,290
Is it covered the roof cover?

555
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:39,310
And if you want to put as a based on experience, you understand that.

556
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:40,870
Well, it's going to rain now.

557
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:42,250
We're not going to do that.

558
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:48,360
Must be bus balcony. And you have big opening.

559
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:53,430
I know that you said the balcony probably very big opening, right?

560
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:58,550
The rain is going to spread to your laundry, right across.

561
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:12,770
If you have this kind of design that that's not not the focus on the clothes.

562
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:17,170
It says, tomorrow. Smart design. Well, we can detect that.

563
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:17,630
Okay?

564
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:20,840
Well, it's going to rain then.

565
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,590
All the window you can, you can

566
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:28,510
go to window automatically to that's useful

567
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:31,780
for people. They wanted to use they would not use that.

568
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:34,390
I

569
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:40,480
said that if you have a driver, or it says all the way the the raining, right?

570
01:25:40,740 --> 01:26:01,520
The rainy season is coming. Well, if you need a hand, you cross outside and think that humanity could be very heavy, even even though is it's not rain but the humidity is happy that you're not going to expect it's going to dry.

571
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:06,600
Yeah, that? So everything is practical.

572
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:16,650
Yeah. In addition, because it's important, is is a doable that the previous team the drainage, right?

573
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:19,670
This is not doable. The government s agency.

574
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:21,610
No. This is not your ability.

575
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:29,800
You can deal with that. And for this, I don't think Particle and the 2nd team, well, I says, oh my God.

576
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:41,670
And so no. And the other thing is, um, you were for each question.

577
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:49,150
In addition to that, you are description about the use case, right?

578
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:55,470
In this case, descriptions a lot of mistake if it works, but no.

579
01:26:56,630 --> 01:27:04,660
And like, um, tears. That's about your same machine skills.

580
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:20,820
If you were in the targets, you want to describe the States because it's very complex, or no, the the stay can be changed.

581
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:38,110
No, I don't see. Okay, you got to change children your project.

582
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:48,290
This is not practical. It cost me that, um last time when I announced.

583
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:52,780
I want to describe our project.

584
01:27:54,500 --> 01:28:05,290
Are you there? Yes. Okay. The dates are from Team four, right?

585
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:10,690
24, four, but not team one, two, three, no.

586
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:18,930
Five. Okay, no. It is not acceptable.

587
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:22,530
Sorry for that. Thank you for your presentation.

588
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:33,430
Okay, we're going to finish soon.

589
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:56,510
I particularly, I because I-A review you were your project before, and I-I know how to rearrange the order of your presentation, right in an evening, evening, foreign for good.

590
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:58,190
Um, I'm sorry to say that.

591
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:07,860
Um, well, it's not acceptable. And the morning, the morning, everything has its, um, some team.

592
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:12,900
It's a pretty good idea, but it just cannot walk it out.

593
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,600
I said, it doesn't matter if you can improve it.

594
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,160
I said that you became improve it.

595
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:21,950
Um till the 2nd assignments, you improve us.

596
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:24,110
I'm going back to correct you.

597
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:31,900
Great. What? What? Genius student unpied was changing?

598
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:38,980
Kindly made on the report. Three Chairman Chemist team.

599
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:44,030
Would you say, oh my God, they don't project or China?

600
01:29:44,190 --> 01:30:12,320
No. So now you know, hong Kong teacher e Jing Ginging.

601
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:19,030
Now, what pushes the man demand effort

602
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:26,460
idea? Um, even this is the chen Jie boy.

603
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:42,310
