1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,120
all right um

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:13,040
the two questions i i want you to discuss in the 
group and turn in jeweler the results right to ta

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,480
one of the question is about as a government 
agency i said this national defense

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,840
departments so when we think about defense 
national defense is something related to military

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:37,040
right it should be very complex so think about 
it it's a complex system right complex system so

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,120
it is not a tiny one it is a big one 
complex one and it should be very reliable

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:57,920
all right it has a bad line and it's a little 
take it long right so then you can take out

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,120
some methodology that's not suitable you're not 
going to use prototyping of course all right

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:17,520
so you should think about reliable you have longer 
no time allowed to finish that so the best answer

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:26,640
should be water for water all right so you 
better use waterfall because it's national or a

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:36,560
governmental agency they need the documents right 
so use water for if your answer is apparel then

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:51,520
you you have enough staff to to group them and 
then they conduct a sub sub project all right okay

13
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:01,120
so then you gotta address that well this project 
is very very complex and they need the documents

14
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,800
and you have the deadline and the requirements 
should be very stable right because they are

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:18,320
not going to to change that often so you're going 
to use a structure methodology right it could be

16
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,840
waterfall and you said that's 
all well we have an experience

17
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:35,840
project manager and they know or he or she knows 
how to subdivide it that's the group into you know

18
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,040
this is a project right that can 
shorten shortens the development spirits

19
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:54,720
then you you use apparel and so fine this and the 
second question is about an executive ceo ryan

20
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,840
wants to have an innovative

21
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:14,880
innovative function that can help 
drill down or have a quick summary

22
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,800
of the company all right quick summary

23
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:31,840
or drill down with a graphical 
display all right so that function

24
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,120
it should be very new and fancy

25
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:45,840
all right so the best question would be 
extreme programming all right because

26
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:59,840
in you might always the secretary of ceo 
often write about the hint or get some

27
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:12,320
some requirement or needs of the ceo 
and you just do it that that's right

28
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:21,600
and probably would change very often right 
because even the ceo just has several notion about

29
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,240
the effects

30
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,720
to show right and you are 
the member of the design team

31
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:46,080
you should propose and conduct the design 
right in a quick way and changes often

32
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,840
right and meets the requirements of the 
ceo in a very short time so the best

33
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:02,080
methodology will be extreme programming you 
might say that i wanted to use scrum well scrum

34
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:17,040
could be right yeah that's the secondary choice 
right because one you have a formal team right um

35
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:26,160
and you will yeah probably you can use the 
scrums so scrum is more formal you have lots of

36
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:34,800
product made out and you have a fixed 
schedule right it's a burn down chart because

37
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:44,080
you're going to finish that in a very very short 
time to do the events like the activity right so

38
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,840
you can you can use scrum right 
but school the team is bigger

39
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:03,360
than extreme programming so like ceos then 
you actually you need to use scrum all right

40
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,800
but you wanted to use it that's the second 
choice the best way would be extreme programming

41
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:21,120
okay so that's the two questions i want to 
see the answer like that yeah okay it's alex

42
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,360
yes um i would like to ask a question where do we 
draw the line between the project when we call it

43
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,240
this is um a long project and which one we 
call this is a short project like where do

44
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,280
we divide the line is it like six months three 
months a year two years ten years like that

45
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,200
okay it's pretty good okay good um question

46
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,800
so what do you think about it says um i wanted to

47
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,320
have this function in half an 
year you think it's long or short

48
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,000
that's i would say it's a long project 
i think it's such a long project

49
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,320
so well actually six months is quite short 
right so yeah it is a question we don't have

50
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:31,360
a definite um or uh precise answer it's a good 
good question well it's basic no basically you

51
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:41,680
want it if it is a project have any year right 
six months we regard as a short right or a lot

52
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:49,200
of things like um we wanted to watch video right 
i'll give you a video um well you got to watch

53
00:07:49,200 --> 00:08:00,000
that's what what do you think about if i said 
that's uh it's 30 minutes is it short or wrong

54
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,280
um well it depends on what kind of video if it's 
documentary then it's short if it's like a movie

55
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,280
then it is short but if it's like a vlog and it 
is long so depends on the video content yeah so

56
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,320
we don't have an exact answer all right so if 
there's a government then usually this longer

57
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:29,280
take longer it's a complex it takes longer right 
if that is a smaller company one year profits loan

58
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,360
okay so when i say that's on government 
agency um you will not expect as a three

59
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,680
months or six months but this is 
probably two years right two years

60
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,720
but there's a two year budget to do that 
right um so yeah it's a good question

61
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,680
when i said that's um well it's a company 
that's there that needs um a very innovative

62
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,000
design then it thinks that i cannot 
wait for very long like a year to see

63
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,680
the results so it could be short right so it's 
shorter than one year so half an year right yeah

64
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:23,440
okay any other question good that may 
be heavier you raise questions again yes

65
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:50,000
okay uh well uh i'm going to skip some um 
let's gonna jump to the unified process

66
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,840
today's lesson line of the day 
today's uh instruction basically is an

67
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:08,080
extension of last week right because that is 
and comes right introductions of the methodology

68
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,080
are not the same but they have something in 
common all right there's something in common

69
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:26,080
the vegetable is something in common and part of 
that is a different expression right so this one

70
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:35,600
unified process you can see that in both textbook 
the tennis unified process is a unified process

71
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:45,840
but you can you cannot see this in 
the methodology right so how come

72
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,040
it's unified process a methodology

73
00:10:52,160 --> 00:11:01,680
both of the book says well probably not we 
focus on process a unified process so labels

74
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,080
do not categorize it as one of the methodology

75
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:18,960
rights for any kind unified process or we 
call as up in short up right you pee in short

76
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,840
it was proposed by a company 
called rational right rational

77
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,840
so r u p unified

78
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,000
so originally

79
00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:07,600
we call this rap because this company was 
required acquired booked by ibm then ibm adopts

80
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:21,600
this and become up right so ibm implements their 
project by using unified process a lot right

81
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:32,720
ibm is an international company we know it 
right this very big company and they have

82
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:44,960
very big projects and very much complex all 
right what do you use unified process right so

83
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:53,760
when we introduce different kinds of methodology i 
said that if you are familiar with the methodology

84
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:01,040
you know how to combine stuff you are not 
going to use just one methodology only

85
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,560
all right so you're going to combine 
stats in this process unified process

86
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,520
because they use many kinds of methodology 
inside that's right if you have documentation

87
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:28,320
right unified process but it is not a traditional 
one okay and this process or this matter right

88
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:39,680
will produce different version all right 
different version they have production right

89
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,400
different version and the the difference between 
traditional methodology because you can see that

90
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,640
well um it has a supporting 
activity a workflow so we can see

91
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:01,840
engineering workflow and support right it's a 
supporting engineering and supporting workflow

92
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:10,880
so it's specified that well we're 
not going um to only model something

93
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:19,040
at some time and then go to the next one not 
that traditional methodology so we can see

94
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:29,840
somehow it's quite similar to you know 
we start right planning is it inception

95
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:39,280
initialization similar inception training 
when i use a different term elaboration do it

96
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:50,480
in detail and more so inception here it comes up 
always y and here we have what and also have how

97
00:14:52,320 --> 00:15:01,280
all right so when we see that it's it's not 
like no like traditional workflow inception

98
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:07,600
we have the why why do we need to do that and we 
also think about the supporting earthquake team

99
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:17,040
and we conducted so by using that because we have 
a very complex system so you are not going to use

100
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:29,040
up right to to design a very tiny project no it 
should be very complex so think about ibm they

101
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:40,800
help you understand that ibm is an international 
company yeah many branches different wallets

102
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:53,600
and different world has its distinct culture 
right so their system gotta be different all

103
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:01,360
right to suit the needs of different country 
all right so make it shorter like seven eleven

104
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,280
right seven eleven is not just one 
right one store that many branch

105
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:18,800
right chance to order a lot of store okay 
so they should have a central processing

106
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,200
and also they need to take care of the transformer

107
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:39,360
right distributed management right so they need 
to keep the data and then also you know well

108
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:43,940
allow

109
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:56,000
the chain store has its different needs all 
right so it make it complex so like that

110
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,280
then you wanted to design a 
system that complex situation

111
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,240
so a group of professional comes from 
different areas need to talk about a lot

112
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,440
of things because it's a very big all 
right and we might test some function

113
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:32,400
all right based on different needs so you're going 
to see that you have idea and couple functions

114
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,680
based on the priority right we 
might do some parts and test it

115
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:52,160
only my deploy means 
implements in some chosen store

116
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:59,840
right so you can see the inception a little 
bit so you can see the shaded shaded area

117
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,960
shaded smaller dash

118
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:13,840
in different phases right so inception 
not just business modeling or requirements

119
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,520
some analysis design testing the 
model s so for each phase model s

120
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,920
of the workflow including the 
supporting supporting workflow all right

121
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,920
and if you see each phase we can 
subdivide it partition it right

122
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:46,880
as iteration what is it different from traditional 
one because iteration is not going to go back

123
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:59,200
let's go forward all right and do this stats and 
then go forwards it will finish that as the first

124
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:10,000
version and come to the others and you're going to 
see for example elaboration is a more requirements

125
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:21,520
let's come clear and more functions yeah 
dance they're going to focus on so actually

126
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:28,240
no there's a lot of methodology 
in this matter all right

127
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:38,240
oh you know it's concordance this is a 
process right so this is unified alphabets

128
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:48,640
together and we also can see extension extensions 
of the unified process right so extended modified

129
00:19:50,320 --> 00:20:06,320
versions extension that because you're going to 
see we have production whoops let me see which one

130
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:19,840
what's good

131
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
fish

132
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,960
this is same as uh previous one but 
extension you're going to see the production

133
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:03,040
right production it's a release of the 
the product line and the supporting ones

134
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,960
you're going to see that well you 
have operation cell operation like

135
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,880
the contents of guinness chapter 
ones on the new edition it adds

136
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:27,600
focus on operation right so you can see step 
up dv op dev opposite that's the operation

137
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:38,480
in support and infrastructure management 
all right so all the supporting referral

138
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,040
it does not have the um the budgets right 
but all that well you can see that's on

139
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,880
that's included in the project management 
so yeah configuration change management

140
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:07,040
change management is about version control 
so change that it's a version one when we

141
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:19,520
when the change from the digits right so from 
one to two there's a big change if there's one

142
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:27,200
third one one the two that that there's smaller 
change right so that is the change management

143
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,760
it's about the version control so here you 
can see setup iteration and incremental

144
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:42,480
right so incrementally from inception 
a couple iteration each iteration

145
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:53,840
has the added value or increments function right 
and go forwards until ends of production so

146
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:04,400
production that is the the result the end 
product so no inception evaporation until okay

147
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:13,680
but for the supporting after after releasing 
the the production then we still need to provide

148
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:20,800
a service right there a year or a maintenance 
as a production we can see that so that is the

149
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:35,840
extension of unified process rather combines 
two two books together it's gonna stats um

150
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,760
it's a longer time

151
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,840
all right

152
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,680
is any question but no

153
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:06,560
so which methodology to use right so last 
time we got down to two questions and now

154
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:17,840
i want you to practice another two right 
another two so it's just a new version

155
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,160
page 3 the new version page 
3 do the exercise h and i

156
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,840
in a group

157
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,040
so h is the page 30

158
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:54,960
suppose you are an analyst right looking for a 
small company to develop an accounting system

159
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,960
accounting so you're going 
to develop an accounting

160
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,880
system we know that content is quite complex 
even there's a smaller company right accounting

161
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:20,640
right support the salary wages right and 
believe personal leave right so here and there

162
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:28,000
um that's accounting quite complex so would you 
use the unified process to develop the system

163
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,920
or would you prefer one of the other approaches 
and why so that is the first question right

164
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,160
smaller company needs a very 
complex and difficult system

165
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:55,840
i suppose you are an analyst developing 
a new information system to automate

166
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,040
the sales transaction and manage inventory 
inventory for each retail store in large

167
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:13,120
chain the system should be installed at each store 
and exchange data with the mainframe computer at

168
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:21,280
the company's head office which use the unified 
process to develop the system or would you prefer

169
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:31,680
one of the other approaches oh why so these 
two questions all right i'm going to give

170
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:38,960
you a round on because you're going to have 
a break or i'm going to give you 25 minutes

171
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,720
right so these two questions if you don't have the

172
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:58,560
book take a picture here right h and i and 
discuss in the group and turn into a result to ta
