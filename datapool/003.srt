1
00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:05,438
>>> TO UKRAINE NOW, AND RUSSIAN
MISSILES TARGETED ANOTHER

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:08,708
UKRAINIAN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.
THIS ONE IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE.

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:12,512
NOW, SECURITY CAMERAS CAPTURED
THIS MOMENT WHEN THOSE MISSILES

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:16,249
HIT THE FACILITY JUST A FEW
HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE REACTORS

5
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,351
THEMSELVES.
OFFICIALS SAY THE PLANT'S POWER

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,155
UNITS ARE STILL OPERATIONAL.
THANKFULLY.

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,691
MEANTIME, UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT
ZELENSKYY INSISTS THERE'S NO

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,660
WALL ON THE FRONT LINE WITH
RUSSIA, SAYING HIS TROOPS ARE

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,431
PREPARING TO TAKE BACK EVEN MORE
TERRITORY AS PART OF ITS

10
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:35,668
SWEEPING COUNTEROFFENSIVE.
LET'S BRING IN CNN MILITARY

11
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:38,705
ANALYST COLONEL CEDRIC LEIGHTON,
RETIRES AIR FORCE COLONEL.

12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:43,076
WE HAVE SEEN RUSSIANS GO AFTER
ANOTHER NUCLEAR POWER PLANT,

13
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,944
COLONEL.
HOW DO YOU MAKE SENSE OF THIS?

14
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:51,117
WHAT IS RUSSIA THINKING?
>> YEAH, ANA, THIS IS REALLY THE

15
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,887
DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THE
RUSSIANS WAGE WAR VERSUS HOW WE

16
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,322
WAGE WAR.
THE RUSSIANS ARE DELIBERATELY

17
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:59,159
TARGETING THE NUCLEAR POWER
PLANTS THAT UKRAINE HAS.

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,230
ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT UKRAINE

19
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,399
CONTROLS.
SO WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE

20
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:10,236
RUSSIANS ARE ALSO PROBABLY GOING
TO USE OR AT LEAST MAKE THE

21
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:14,574
ATTEMPT AT USING THE NUCLEAR
POWER PLANTS THAT ARE STILL IN

22
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,911
UKRAINIAN HANDS AS POSSIBLE
WEAPONS AGAINST THE UKRAINIANS

23
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,380
THEMSELVES.
TARGETING THEM BY FORCING THEM

24
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,382
OFF LINE.
THAT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

25
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:26,186
IMPACT ON THE UKRAINIAN ENERGY
GRID AND ON THE POWER SUPPLY IN

26
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:30,022
UKRAINE ITSELF.
SO THAT IS THE RUSSIAN GOAL.

27
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:33,359
IT'S REALLY A WAR AGAINST THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION MORE THAN

28
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,695
ANYTHING ELSE.
>> PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY SAYS THIS

29
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:40,366
CURRENT PHASE RIGHT NOW IS NOT A
LULL, THIS IS, QUOTE,

30
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,035
PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT
SEQUENCE.

31
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,504
A PREPARATION FOR THE LIBERATION
OF EVEN MORE CITIES.

32
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,941
ON ONE HAND, HE'S EXPRESSING
CONFIDENCE.

33
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:52,278
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S TRYING TO
RALLY THE TROOPS, BUT DO YOU

34
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,614
THINK IT'S WISE FOR THIME
PREVIEW THAT THAT'S THEIR PLAN?

35
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,718
>> IT KIND OF GOES BOTH WAYS.
ON THE ONE HAND, I WOULD SAY

36
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,954
IT'S BEST NOT TO PREVIEW THE
PLAN.

37
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,256
YOU KNOW THERE, IS SOMETHING TO
BE SAID FOR OPERATIONAL SECURITY

38
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,391
AND FOR KEEPING THESE THINGS
UNDER WRAPS.

39
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:10,930
THE OTHER THING IS, THIS MAY BE
A WAY OF MOTIVATING THE TROOPS

40
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,300
AND OF TELLING THEM AND ALSO THE
CIVILIAN POPULATION, FRANKLY,

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,770
AND TELLING THEM THAT THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT'S COMING NEXT.

42
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,675
YOU CAN EXPECT MORE ADVANCES,
AND IT MAY IN THE THIRD ANALYSIS

43
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,745
BE A SIGNAL TO THE WEST, SAYING
HEY, WE'RE NOT STOPPING.

44
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,615
WE'RE MOVING FORWARD, AND WE
NEED YOUR HELP.

45
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:36,222
SO THERE'S CLEARLY A
MULTI-FACETED APPROACH THAT

46
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,525
PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY IS
UNDERTUNDE

47
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,893
UNDERTAKING AND THEY WANT TO
MAKE SURE THEY CAN MAINTAIN

48
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:42,362
THEIR MOMENTUM AND THEY NEED THE
POPULATION TO STAY ON THEIR SIDE

49
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,697
AND THEY ALSO NEED THE WEST TO
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

50
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,700
WEAPONS.
>> AND OF COURSE, WINTER IS ON

51
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,003
ITS WAY TO THE RENALEN.
HOW IS THAT GOING TO CHANGE

52
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,406
THINGS, DO YOU THINK?
>> GENERAL WINTER, AS HE WAS

53
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:57,176
KNOWN DURING WORLD WAR II
EUPHEMISTICALLY, IS A KEY

54
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,613
ELEMENT IN THE WEATHER IN
UKRAINE AND REALLY IN THE WAY IN

55
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:06,419
WHICH ALL OF THE FORCES MOVE OR
DON'T MOVE OVER THAT TERRAIN.

56
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,455
SO AS COLDER TEMPERATURES COME
INTO PLAY, WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO

57
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:14,260
SEE IS IN SOME WAYS IT'S GOING
TO BE EASIER FOR TANKS AND

58
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,930
ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS TO
MOVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, UP TO A

59
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,832
POINT.
BUT AFTER A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE,

60
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,835
THINGS CAN START TO FREEZE.
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT

61
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,672
KIND OF ANTIFREEZE, THINGS COULD
GET STUCK.

62
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:29,776
AND THAT COULD REALLY PUT A
DAMPER ON THINGS, AND IT COULD

63
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:34,147
STALL OUT ANY ADVANCES THAT THE
UKRAINIANS ARE PLANNING.

64
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,515
AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE
RUSSIANS, OF COURSE.

65
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:39,952
SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS I
THINK THE UKRAINIANS ARE MOVING

66
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:44,057
FORWARD AS MUCH AS THEY POSSIBLY
CAN TO GAIN AS MUCH TERRITORY

67
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,160
BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE REALLY
COLD TEMPERATURES.

68
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,462
>> LET'S SWITCH GEARS FOR A
QUICK MOMENT HERE.

69
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,965
LISTEN TO WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN
JUST SAID ABOUT TAIWAN AND HOW

70
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:57,337
THE U.S. WOULD RESPOND IF CHINA
WERE TO INVADE.

71
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,673
>> THERE'S A ONE CHINA POLICY,
AND TAIWAN MAKES THEIR OWN

72
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,241
JUDGMENTS ABOUT THEIR
INDEPENDENCE.

73
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:06,179
WE ARE NOT MOVING, NOT
ENCOURAGING THEIR BEING

74
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,247
INDEPENDENT.
THAT'S THEIR DECISION.

75
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,283
>> BUT WOULD U.S. FORCES DEFEND
THE ISLAND?

76
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,486
>> YES, IF IN FACT THERE WAS AN
UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK.

77
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:18,858
>> SO UNLIKE UKRAINE, TO BE
CLEAR, SIR, U.S. FORCES, U.S.

78
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,662
MEN AND WOMEN, WOULD DEFEND
TAIWAN IN THE EVENT OF A CHINESE

79
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,097
INVASION?
>> YES.

80
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,400
>> SO THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID SOMETHING

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,936
LIKE THIS.
BUT THAT'S A LOT LESS AMBIGUOUS,

82
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:33,840
AND THAT IS NOT OFFICIAL U.S.
POLICY.

83
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,909
WHY GO THAT FAR?
IS THAT RISKY?

84
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:41,680
>> IT IS CERTAINLY RISKY, ANA,
AND I THINK IN PART WHAT THE

85
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,386
PRESIDENT WAS DOING IS HE WAS
OUTLINING THE FACT THAT AND THE

86
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,956
CHINESE ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS,
THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS AN

87
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,827
OPERATION PLAN TO DEFEND TAIWAN.
WE HAVE HAD ONE FOR MANY YEARS.

88
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,331
AND THE CHINESE KNOW THAT WE
HAVE THIS PLAN.

89
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,634
THEY ARE ALSO MANEUVERING THEIR
FORCES TO SHOW THAT IT WOULD BE

90
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,438
VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO DEFEND
TAIWAN.

91
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:09,575
THEY CAN DEFEND CERTAIN PARTS OF
IT, BUT THE TAIWANESE ARE AT

92
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:13,479
RISK OF BEING SURROUNDED BY A
CHINESE NAVAL BLOCKADE AS ONE

93
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,282
EXAMPLE, THE CHINESE NOW HAVE
THAT CAPABILITY, WHICH THEY

94
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:20,586
REALLY DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE, AND
THEY SHOWED THAT IN THEIR LATEST

95
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:23,322
EXERCISE.
SO THE PRESIDENT IS GOING AHEAD

96
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:27,560
WITH SOME OF THESE STATEMENTS
KIND OF SIGNALING TO BOTH TAIWAN

97
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,631
AND CHINA THAT YES, THE UNITED
STATES WOULD DEFEND IT IF THERE

98
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:37,437
WERE AN UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK ON
TAIWAN, BUT IF THE COUNTRY, IF

99
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,873
TAIWAN DECIDED TO PEACEFULLY
REUNIFY WITH CHINA, THEN NONE OF

100
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,842
THIS, OF COURSE, WOULD BE ON THE
TABLE.

101
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,678
SO THAT'S KIND OF A MESSAGE THAT
HE'S SENDING.

102
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:50,616
HE'S SAYING THE ONE CHINA POLICY
STILL STANDS, BUT THAT THE

103
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:54,654
CHINESE BETTER NOT GO AHEAD AND
TRY TO INVADE THE ISLAND.

104
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,422
>> NOT TO DO ANYTHING
FORCEFULLY.

105
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,790
THANK YOU, COLONEL CEDRIC
LEIGHTON.
